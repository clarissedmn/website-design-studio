  "You can not discover Taipei without visiting its emblem : Taipei 101. Named after its number of floors, the Tower ranks sixth as the highest building in the world. Built in 2004, it is an architectural marvel in many ways. Designed to withstand the earthquakes and typhoons that are not uncommon here in Taiwan, the 101 is one of the most stable skyscrapers in the world. The Elephant Mountain hiking offers spectacular views both at day and night of the tower !",
  "In order to better understand the theme of our workshop, we had to discover and immerse ourselves in the Taiwanese culture. Thanks to Sharon, Brian & Rolly, we learned about the  strong relationships between Taiwanese but especially between children and parents. The Taiwanese tend to put great emphasis on maintaining mutual respect and positive relationships amongst the family members. That's why it is not unusual for children to welcome parents at home when they are no longer able to live alone in their own home. ",
  "We have the opportunity to visit the Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab which has the mission to forge a new ecosystem for cultural innovation, to promote cultural experimentation and social innovation, and to provide cultural experiences and explorations. C-Lab hosts numerous international forums, exhibitions and an art festival. Local and international artists, interdisciplinary creators and the public are invited to participate, see, interact and discuss. ",
  "Through these cultural differences, I met a lot of people during this week especially Taiwanese and German people in my workshop group about « Urban Resilience & Disaster Management ». In this way, we try to made up an international mix of members in order to work together constructively with differences in work style and communication methods. It was interesting to see the difference between how you imagine your own culture and how your culture is perceived by others.",
  "During the workhop, our group talked together about the fact that Taipei is a scaling city and must face demographic changes. Due to a aged society and low birth rate, the city becomes a shrinking city. New socio-economic challenges appear : how to adapt housings, healthcare, mobility or environment?  Our goal was to understand in detail the impacts of these changes and to create possible solutions for the future city of Taipei.",
  "Walking through Taipei City, we discovered that every metro station had its own stamp with its unique design. Later in the week, we realized that there are stamping stations not only in Taipei but also all across the country ! It's the best colorful souvenir to trace your footsteps as you explore Taïwan. Stamp-collecting can be one part of the Taïwan tourist experience and lets you take part in the country's incredibly creative culture. ",
  "Biking is a convenient and environmentally friendly way to get around Taipei. UBike, the Taipei City public bicycle system, is an excellent way to explore the city. The UBike's goal is to encourage people to use less polluting and low energy consumption transportation, in order to improve urban traffic congestion, reduce environmental pollution and energy consumption purposes. It has become a real lifestyle for Taiwanese people."
